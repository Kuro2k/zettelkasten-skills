# Zettelkasten Principles & Taxonomy

## Core Philosophy
The Zettelkasten is a "thinking tool" designed to facilitate unexpected connections and emergent insights. It is not just an archive; it is a communication partner.

### 1. Atomicity
*   **Rule:** One note = One idea.
*   **Why:** Enables precise linking and effective retrieval (RAG).
*   **Action:** Decompose complex arguments into single propositions.

### 2. Connectivity
*   **Rule:** Notes are defined by their relationships, not their categories.
*   **Why:** Simulates the associative nature of the human brain.
*   **Action:** Always link new notes to existing ones. "Orphaned" notes are useless.

## The Tripartite Taxonomy

### 1. Fleeting Notes (Inbox)
*   **What:** Temporary captures, raw thoughts, voice memos.
*   **Context:** Messy, incomplete.
*   **Action:** Must be processed (Distilled) and then deleted or archived.

### 2. Literature Notes (Reference)
*   **What:** Synthesized ideas from external sources (books, articles).
*   **Constraint:** DO NOT copy-paste. Rewrite in your own words to ensure understanding.
*   **Format:** Contains quotes (`>`) and your synthesis.

### 3. Permanent Notes (Main Vault)
*   **What:** Your own synthesized thoughts, fully formed and atomic.
*   **Goal:** Written for publication or "future you."
*   **Structure:** See `permanent-note-template.md`.
*   **Criteria:**
    *   Self-contained (understandable without context).
    *   Atomic (one idea).
    *   Densely linked.
